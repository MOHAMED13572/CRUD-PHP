# CRUD-PHP
educational project about cruds
I created this CRUD project just for education and itsn't valid for any real world application 
database in this project contains :
-product_id : auto increament integer.
-product_type : varchar(100) contains the type of the product {phone laptop ...}
-company : varchar(100) contains the company that made the product {samsung apple ...}
-quantity :integer(11)
-price_for_unit : integer(11)

good luck!
